# Polling, Interrupts, and DMA

Welcome to `faux_s` (pronounced "OS") which is a fake OS running on Linux.
You're going to use `faux_s` as a test-bed to understand

1. the trade-offs between polling and interrupts, and
2. the trade-off between byte-by-byte reading of data, and DMA.

It emulates two devices, a boop generator, and a meme generator.

Two subsequent days of exercises will use `faux_s` to investigate these two issues.

Simple `make` comments include:

- `make` to build everything
- `make build` ditto
- `make clean` to remove all generated files

## `faux_s` Design

`faux_s` has a number of components:

- **Interrupts** - `faux_interrupts.c` includes logic to emulate an interrupt controller that contains a vector of Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs).
    It uses Linux `signal`s to emulate interrupts.
	Signals, like interrupts, stop whatever is currently executing, and use their stack for signal execution (similar to if kernel code is executing when an interrupt arrives).
- **Devices** - `faux_dev.c` emulates a few devices.
	The devices that current work are the *boop device* which creates Penny boops, and the *meme device* which spits out random memes.
	Each device has a register we can *write* into which controls how frequently the boops and memes arrive, and a register that can be *read*.
	The latter gives us the data in the device!
	This can be the characters of the boop, or the characters of the meme.
	The function `faux-s_dev_reg_read` is well documented, and you should read and understand its signature.
	`faux_s` creates a lot of overhead for each read to a device to *emulate* the large costs of going out to I/O.
- **DMA** - `faux_dma.c` includes a simple DMA interface (that essentially uses a "ring" with a single entry).
	The interface enables an OS to enqueue a new, empty buffer that the device will later populate.
	Then the OS can dequeue that populated buffer and process the data.

The different *modes* of execution for the code can be toggled in the `#define`s at the top of `main.c`.

You should read through `main.c` to get the gist of most of it.

## Exercises: Polling vs. Interrupts

You're going to run the code in two configurations:

1. Using polling to get device data.
	This makes sure that `#define POLL_IO` is not commented out.
	You can run the program for the boop device (`#define BOOPDEV` uncommented), and for the meme device.
2. With polling disabled, instead using interrupts.
	In this configuration, the `dev_isr` will receive periodic activations from your device!

You should be able to get by mostly only knowing the code in `main.c`.
Please answer the following questions:

- **Q1:** What happens when you run the system using polling?
- **Q2:** What happens when you run the system using interrupts?
- **Q3:** How can you explain the difference?
	Please be specific.
- **Q4:** A famous google interview question: How can you tell by which way a stack grows in C on your architecture?
	Brainstorm this as a group and test it out.
	Use what you learned from that exercise to figure out which stack the interrupt handler `dev_isr` is executing on.
	Explain what you think is happening, and how that is possible?
	In other words: how are stacks used with signals in Linux?
- **Q5:** Use the meme device both modes.
	What is happening here?
	What solutions do you foresee?

## Exercises: DMA

## A Note on `gdb`

If you want to use `gdb` with programs that use frequent signals, and wish to avoid it reporting every signal, use:

```
(gdb) handle SIGUSR1 noprint nostop
```
