# Polling, Interrupts, and DMA

Welcome to `faux_s` (pronounced "OS") which is a fake OS running on Linux.
You're going to use `faux_s` as a test-bed to understand

1. the trade-offs between polling and interrupts, and
2. the trade-off between byte-by-byte reading of data, and DMA.

It emulates two devices, a boop generator, and a meme generator.

Two subsequent days of exercises will use `faux_s` to investigate these two issues.

Simple `make` comments include:

- `make` to build everything
- `make build` ditto
- `make clean` to remove all generated files

## `faux_s` Design

`faux_s` has a number of components:

- **Interrupts** - `faux_interrupts.c` includes logic to emulate an interrupt controller that contains a vector of Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs).
    It uses Linux `signal`s to emulate interrupts.
	Signals, like interrupts, stop whatever is currently executing, and use their stack for signal execution (similar to if kernel code is executing when an interrupt arrives).
- **Devices** - `faux_dev.c` emulates a few devices.
	The devices that current work are the *boop device* which creates Penny boops, and the *meme device* which spits out random memes.
	Each device has a register we can *write* into which controls how frequently the boops and memes arrive, and a register that can be *read*.
	The latter gives us the data in the device!
	This can be the characters of the boop, or the characters of the meme.
	The function `faux-s_dev_reg_read` is well documented, and you should read and understand its signature.
	`faux_s` creates a lot of overhead for each read to a device to *emulate* the large costs of going out to I/O.
- **DMA** - `faux_dma.c` includes a simple DMA interface (that essentially uses a "ring" with a single entry).
	The interface enables an OS to enqueue a new, empty buffer that the device will later populate.
	Then the OS can dequeue that populated buffer and process the data.

The different *modes* of execution for the code can be toggled in the `#define`s at the top of `main.c`.

You should read through `main.c` to get the gist of most of it.

## Exercises: Polling vs. Interrupts

You're going to run the code in two configurations:

1. Using polling to get device data.
	This makes sure that `#define POLL_IO` is not commented out.
	You can run the program for the boop device (`#define BOOPDEV` uncommented), and for the meme device.
2. With polling disabled, instead using interrupts.
	In this configuration, the `dev_isr` will receive periodic activations from your device!

You should be able to get by mostly only knowing the code in `main.c`.
Please answer the following questions:

- **Q1:** What happens when you run the system using polling?

The CPU does less 'useful work' in the same amount of time in comparison to interrupt driven I/O.

- **Q2:** What happens when you run the system using interrupts?

The CPU does more 'useful work' in the same amount of time in comparison to polling.

- **Q3:** How can you explain the difference?

When polling, the CPU has to constantly check if there is device data ready to be processed which takes up CPU cycles, but when using interrupts, the CPU is alerted when the device is ready to be used.

- **Q4:** A famous google interview question: How can you tell by which way a stack grows in C on your architecture?
	Brainstorm this as a group and test it out.

One of the ways to tell which way a stack grows is to print the addresses of two local variables in the function call to see whether the stack grows upwards or downwards on the architecture by the difference between the addresses. 

	Use what you learned from that exercise to figure out which stack the interrupt handler `dev_isr` is executing on.

The interrupt handler `dev_isr` is executing on the User Stack since it is a regular funtion rather then a system call.

	Explain what you think is happening, and how that is possible?

`dev_isr` is still operating on the User Stack since it is a normally defined function, not a system call.

	In other words: how are stacks used with signals in Linux?

A regularly defined function will have a stack on user level.  A signal for a system call would cause a stack on kernel level to be created.

- **Q5:** Use the meme device both modes.
	What is happening here?
	What solutions do you foresee?

## Exercises: DMA

Now lets hack in some DMA!

- **Q1:** Only the meme device provides DMA.
	Why?
	Why does DMA make more sense for the meme device?
- **Q2:** Not so much a question as a puzzle:
	Implement the `main.c` code to use the DMA features of the meme device!
	Note that there is a lot of documentation of the DMA functions.
- **Q3:** Why does DMA have such an impact here?
	The constant `WORK_AMNT` in `faux_dev.c` changes the simulated latency of the interconnect used to "talk" to the device.
	How does changing `WORK_AMNT` impact the effectiveness of DMA?
	What does this mean for non-simulated systems?
- **Q4:** Does your implementation pass `valgrind`^[Note, you might need to `apt-get install valgrind`]?
	Valgrind is a tool that helps you debug your C.
	It detects errors in using `malloc` and `free`; double freeing a piece of memory? not freeing memory?

## A Note on `gdb`

If you want to use `gdb` with programs that use frequent signals, and wish to avoid it reporting every signal, use:

```
(gdb) handle SIGUSR1 noprint nostop
```
